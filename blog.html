				<h4>9 Years of AMD Processors Vulnerable to 2 New Side-Channel Attacks</h4>
				<time>March 09, 2020</time>
				<p>AMD processors from as early as 2011 to 2019 carry previously undisclosed
					vulnerabilities that open them to two new different side-channel attacks, according
					to a freshly published research.
				</p>

				<div class="collapse" id="collapse1">
					<div class="card-body spc">
						<p>
							Known as "Take A Way," the new potential attack vectors leverage the L1 data
							(L1D) cache way predictor in AMD's Bulldozer microarchitecture to leak
							sensitive
							data from the processors and compromise the security by recovering the
							secret
							key used during encryption.
							The research was published by a group of academics from the Graz University
							of
							Technology and Research Institute of Computer Science and Random Systems
							(IRISA), who responsibly disclosed the vulnerabilities to AMD back in August
							2019.
							"We are aware of a new white paper that claims potential security exploits
							in
							AMD CPUs, whereby a malicious actor could manipulate a cache-related feature
							to
							potentially transmit user data in an unintended way," AMD said in an
							advisory
							posted on its website over the weekend.
							"The researchers then pair this data path with known and mitigated software
							or
							speculative execution side-channel vulnerabilities. AMD believes these are
							not
							new speculation-based attacks."

				<h4>Dell Releases A New Cybersecurity Utility To Detect BIOS Attacks</h4>
				<time>April 14, 2020</time>
				<p>Computer manufacturing giant Dell has released a new security tool for its commercial
					customers that aims to protect their computers from stealthy and sophisticated
					cyberattacks involving the compromise of the BIOS.
				</p>
				<div class="collapse" id="collapse2">
					<div class="card-body spc">
						<p>
							Dubbed 'SafeBIOS Events & Indicators of Attack' (IoA), the new endpoint
							security software is a behavior-based threat detection system that alerts
							users when BIOS settings of their computers undergo some unusual changes.
							BIOS (Basic Input Output System) is a small but highly-privileged program
							that handles critical operations and starts your computer before handing it
							over to your operating system.
							Protecting the BIOS program is crucial because:
							Changes to the system BIOS settings could allow malicious software to run
							during the boot process,
							Once a hacker takes over the BIOS, he can stealthily control the targeted
							computer and gain access to the data stored on it,
							Malware in BIOS remains persistent and doesn't get away even when you format
							or erase your entire hard drive,
							Attacks against the BIOS are typically hard to detect because they are
							invisible to antivirus and other security software installed on the system,
							With stealth access to one of the compromised systems in an enterprise IT
							network, sophisticated attackers could move laterally throughout the
							infrastructure.

				<h4>Dark Nexus: A New Emerging IoT Botnet Malware Spotted in the Wild</h4>
				<time>April 08, 2020</time>
				<p>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new emerging IoT botnet threat that
					leverages compromised smart devices to stage 'distributed denial-of-service'
					attacks, potentially triggered on-demand through platforms offering DDoS-for-hire
					services.
				</p>

				<div class="collapse" id="collapse4">
					<div class="card-body spc">
						<p>
							The botnet, named "dark_nexus" by Bitdefender researchers, works by
							employing credential stuffing attacks against a variety of devices, such as
							routers (from Dasan Zhone, Dlink, and ASUS), video recorders, and thermal
							cameras, to co-opt them into the botnet.
							So far, dark_nexus comprises at least 1,372 bots, acting as a reverse proxy,
							spanning across various locations in China, South Korea, Thailand, Brazil,
							and Russia.
							"While it might share some features with previously known IoT botnets, the
							way some of its modules have been developed makes it significantly More
							potent and robust," the researchers said. "For example, payloads are
							compiled for 12 different CPU architectures and dynamically delivered based
							on the victim's configuration."
							Evidence gathered by Bitdefender points to greek.Helios as the individual
							behind the development of dark_nexus, who is a known botnet author infamous
							for selling DDoS services on social media platforms and using a YouTube
							channel to advertise its capabilities.

				<h4>Marriott Suffers Second Breach Exposing Data of 5.2 Million Hotel Guests</h4>
				<time>March 31, 2020</time>
				<p>International hotel chain Marriott today disclosed a data breach impacting nearly 5.2
					million hotel guests, making it the second security incident to hit the company in
					recent years.
				</p>

				<div class="collapse" id="collapse5">
					<div class="card-body spc">
						<p>
							"At the end of February 2020, we identified that an unexpected amount of
							guest information may have been accessed using the login credentials of two
							employees at a franchise property," Marriott said in a statement.
							"We believe this activity started in mid-January 2020. Upon discovery, we
							confirmed that the login credentials were disabled, immediately began an
							investigation, implemented heightened monitoring, and arranged resources to
							inform and assist guests."
							The incident exposed guests' personal information such as contact details
							(name, mailing address, email address, and phone number), loyalty account
							information (account number and points balance), and additional information
							such as company, gender, dates of births, room preferences, and language
							preferences.
							The hospitality giant said an investigation into the breach was ongoing, but
							said there was no evidence that Marriott Bonvoy account passwords or PINs,
							payment card information, passport information, national IDs, or driver's
							license numbers were compromised.
							Marriott has also set up a self-service online portal for guests to check
							whether their personal details were involved in the breach, and what
							categories of information were exposed. In addition, it's offering affected
							users an option to enroll in IdentityWorks, a personal information
							monitoring service, free of charge for 1 year.

				<h4>Russian Pleads Guilty to Running 'CardPlanet' to Sell Stolen Credit Cards</h4>
				<time>January 24, 2020</time>
				<p>Aleksei Burkov, a 29-year-old Russian hacker, on Thursday pleaded guilty to multiple
					criminal charges for running two illegal websites that helped cyber criminals commit
					More than $20 million in credit card fraud.
				</p>

				<div class="collapse" id="collapse6">
					<div class="card-body spc">
						<p>
							The first website Burkov operated was an online marketplace for buying and
							selling stolen credit card and debit card numbers—called Cardplanet—which
							roughly hosted 150,000 payment card details between the years 2009 and 2013.
							Cardplanet marketplace offered stolen payment card details for anywhere
							between $2.50 and $10 a card, depending on the card type, country of origin,
							and the availability of card owner information.
							The carding website even offered a paid service that allowed buyers to
							instantly verify if a stolen payment card were still valid.
							"Many of the cards offered for sale belonged to U.S. citizens. The stolen
							credit card data from More than 150,000 compromised payment cards was
							allegedly sold on Burkov's site and has resulted in over $20 million in
							fraudulent purchases made on U.S. credit cards," the Department of Justice
							said in an old press release.
							The majority of such stolen credit cards are obtained using illegal means
							such as phishing and the use of banking malware, malicious software
							implanted into cash registers at the stores, leaked databases, and hacked
							financial account passwords.
							Besides Cardplanet, Burkov also masterminded a separate invite-only forum
							website for elite cybercriminals where they advertised stolen personal
							identity information, malicious software, and other illegal services, like
							money laundering and hacking services.
							"To obtain membership in Burkov's cybercrime forum, prospective members
							needed three existing members to "vouch" for their good reputation among
							cybercriminals and to provide a sum of money, normally $5,000, as
							insurance," the Department of Justice said on Thursday.
